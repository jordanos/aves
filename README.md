# Aves
`Audio visual encryption and sharing system`

### What is the use of it?
> Aves is used to share encrypted video files that can only be played on the app.
> Why encrypted? umm good question. There are lots of: content creators creating entertainment videos, teachers creating tutorials, movies...
> and all this people are not benefiting from their work because once its out on the internet everybody can have it for free which makes them(the creators) furstrated and leads to low quality contents to be created.
> This is where Aves comes in, despite the videos out being on the internet no one can play(watch) them because they are encrypted files.
> So how can they play them? well using the Aves mobile apps they can. but only if they bought the video.
> So basically they can share the videos anywhere but one can watch it if he only pays the fee for the video.
